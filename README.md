## Projects

Below are some of the projects I’ve worked on, demonstrating my practical skills in various areas of cybersecurity.

### 1. **Web Application Penetration Testing**
- **Description:** Conducted a thorough penetration test on a sample e-commerce website to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication.
- **Tools Used:** Burp Suite, Kali Linux, OWASP ZAP
- **Results:** Found critical vulnerabilities that were successfully patched, including an SQL injection that allowed unauthorized access to the database.

### 2. **Incident Response & Malware Analysis**
- **Description:** Participated in a simulated incident response scenario involving a ransomware attack. Analyzed malware samples and provided a detailed report on how the attack could have been prevented.
- **Tools Used:** IDA Pro, Wireshark, Volatility
- **Results:** Successfully reversed the malware and provided recommendations to strengthen network defenses, including enhancing endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.

### 3. **Network Security Hardening**
- **Description:** Implemented network security best practices for a small organization, including firewall rules, VPN configuration, and segmentation to reduce attack surface.
- **Tools Used:** pfSense, Snort, Wireshark
- **Results:** Improved overall network security posture by isolating critical assets and reducing the risk of lateral movement in the event of a breach.

### 4. **Vulnerability Management Program**
- **Description:** Designed and implemented a vulnerability management program for a medium-sized company, including scanning, patching, and reporting.
- **Tools Used:** Nessus, OpenVAS, JIRA
- **Results:** Reduced the organization’s vulnerability exposure by over 40% within the first three months.
